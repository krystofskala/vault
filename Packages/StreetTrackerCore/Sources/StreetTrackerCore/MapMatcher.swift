/// MVP simplification: this is nearest-segment matching, not a full
/// Hidden-Markov-Model map matcher. It doesn't reason about direction of
/// travel or path continuity between fixes, so it can occasionally snap to
/// a parallel street (e.g. two close, roughly-parallel roads). That's an
/// acceptable trade for a first version; if it proves noisy in practice,
/// the natural upgrade is to weight candidates by consistency with the
/// previously matched segment / heading. See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
