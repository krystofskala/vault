 * border-lost branch of tickHold/tickMove signals by returning `true`, so whenever the frame that
 * lost the border was the last on the stack the flag was set and never read. The mascot went to
 * ordinary reselection while airborne and unattached, nothing was eligible, and the (faithful)
 * totalFrequency==0 recovery teleported it above the window. On screen: a mascot that should have
 * dropped off a vanishing wall instead rained down from the top.
