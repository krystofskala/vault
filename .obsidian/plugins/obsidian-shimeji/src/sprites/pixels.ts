/**
 * Copies one frame's box out of a sheet into a buffer of its own.
 *
 * The crop is the box as selected, never trimmed down to the art inside it: every frame of an
 * animation then has the same dimensions, which is what a hand-made pack looks like, and the
 * anchor is what positions the sprite. Trimming each frame to its own silhouette instead would
 * make the pose files disagree about their own size for no gain.
 *
 * A box running past the edge of the sheet keeps its requested size and leaves the outside
 * transparent, rather than returning a smaller image than the caller asked for.
