 * Just the plant room for now — self-drawn by the plugin, no image file needed. The office (a desk
 * the resident sat behind, with a second canvas painted over the mascot to fake the furniture being
 * in front of it) was removed by request: the overlay it depended on kept drifting out of register
 * with the room behind it in ways that were never fully pinned down, and a plain room with no such
 * trick has nothing to drift. Two supplied-artwork styles (apartment, cellar) existed before that
 * and were removed too; their code is gone from apartment.ts/cellar.ts (deleted), but the plant
 * room's own definition, `LIVING_ROOM`, is still exported from roomDef.ts — RoomView.ts keeps it as
 * the generic "image not ready yet" fallback for any *future* image-based room, even with none
 * currently registered here. Adding a room back is a definition file and an entry here — the
 * feature itself has no other idea how many there are.
