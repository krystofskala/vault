/**
 * Places a room inside a pane and turns its hand-authored surfaces into the same `Ledge` list the
 * engine builds from real DOM rects — so a mascot indoors is running the identical physics and
 * routing it runs outdoors, over a world that simply happens to be small.
 *
 * Two things this has to get right:
 *
 * **Integer scale only.** Pixel art at a fractional scale is mush. The room picks the largest whole
 * multiple that fits the pane and centres the leftover, rather than stretching to fill.
 *
 * **Mirroring.** The door faces the workspace the mascot came from, so the whole room — art and
 * geometry together — flips when the pane is on the other side of the window. Flipping only one of
 * the two would put the visible door on one side and the working door on the other, which is the
 * kind of bug that looks like haunting.
