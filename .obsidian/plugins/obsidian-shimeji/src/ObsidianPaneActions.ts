/**
 * The real (Obsidian-specific) implementation of PaneActions. Unlike everything else this
 * plugin ports, `resizeBy` leans on Obsidian internals that are *not* part of the public plugin
 * API (`obsidian.d.ts` has no resize/dimension surface on WorkspaceItem/WorkspaceSplit at all) —
 * confirmed working, not guessed, by reading the source of a real published plugin that does the
 * same thing (github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-resize-split): `WorkspaceItem.dimension`/
 * `.setDimension(percent)`, `WorkspaceSplit.getElSize(el)`, and `Workspace.requestResize()`.
 * These exist on the real runtime objects today but aren't guaranteed by any stability contract,
 * unlike every other API this plugin touches — if a future Obsidian release changes them,
 * resizing degrades to a no-op (the same graceful fallback as any other absent PaneActions
 * method), nothing else breaks.
 *
 * `beginThrow` is the one genuinely faithful piece: `Workspace.moveLeafToPopout` is a real,
 * documented, stable API, and Electron intentionally lets a renderer's own `window.moveTo()`
 * drive its native window (unlike a browser tab, which restricts this to script-opened popups) —
 * so this really does fling a separate OS window around, the same kind of action the original
 * engine performs, just reached through Obsidian's popout API instead of a JNA native bridge.
 * Desktop-only: moveLeafToPopout throws on mobile, caught below and treated as "unsupported."
