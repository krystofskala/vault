 * is a fraction of the window, not a pixel count.
 *
 * Ported from shimeji-buddy (`computeResponsiveSize`), with one adaptation: buddy's setting was a
 * pixel height, so it could clamp the *rendered* size directly and guarantee a usable touch
 * target. Ours is a multiplier applied to whatever the pack's art happens to be, so the clamp is
 * on the factor instead — a pack whose sprites are unusually large or small keeps that character
 * rather than being normalised away, which is the tradeoff for not knowing the art's size here.
