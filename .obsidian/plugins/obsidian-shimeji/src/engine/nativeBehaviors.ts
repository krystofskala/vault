 * Clamps horizontal position to the *screen's* own left/right edges, so a hard throw can't send
 * the mascot drifting off past the window edge into permanent freefall (once x is outside every
 * floor's x-range, nothing can ever land it again).
 *
 * **Window-sourced walls only.** This used to consider every wall ledge, pane sides included, by
 * taking `max(all left walls)` / `min(all right walls)` — which is only meaningful for walls that
 * genuinely bound the whole world. A *pane's* side is a local feature, not a boundary: with
 * Obsidian's ordinary side-by-side layout, the left sidebar's own right wall sits somewhere in the
 * middle of the screen, so `maxX` collapsed to that x for every mascot in the *entire* window,
 * including ones far to its right with nothing actually in their way. A mascot released anywhere
 * right of it got yanked to that exact coordinate on its very first falling tick, `vx` zeroed,
 * then immediately "caught" the pane wall it had just been teleported onto. Confirmed from a live
 * trace 2026-08-13: four separate releases from x=808, x=978 and two respawns all landed at
 * *precisely* `x: 482.16668701171875` — one shared pane edge, reached instantly, every time. That
 * is the "mascot doesn't trace any fall, it just teleports and snaps to a wall" report, and it
 * also explains why several earlier attempts (all aimed at window walls and worldTop) changed
 * nothing about it.
 *
 * Pane walls remain fully functional for what they're actually for — being climbed, grabbed and
 * detected (`findWallAt`/`findClingableWall`/`updateWallCeilingAdherence`, all untouched) — which
 * is also how the real engine treats a tracked window's edges: something to *land on* via border
 * detection, never something that rewrites the mascot's position from across the screen. The
 * window's own walls apply regardless of `y`, since this safety net must not have a gap above
 * `worldTop` (see Ledges.ts, where window walls start at `worldTop` for climbing purposes).

 * ceiling ledge spanning the mascot's x, and a pane's underside is a ceiling ledge too. In a
 * horizontally-split workspace one pane's bottom edge sits partway *down* the screen, so that
 * became the world's "ceiling" for everything above it: a mascot thrown upward from below it was
 * slammed straight down onto that line and had its upward velocity zeroed, in a single tick.
 * Reproduced from a live trace 2026-08-13 — two different throws (from x=1098 vx=-1469, and from
